       "'I\\'m a tad reluctant to write a review as I run the risk of spoiling one of the things I love about the place, it has just the right amount of \\'busy\\'.  Staff are awesome, and care that you have a great experience.  Outside patio is a wonderful.  It\\'s the dogs bollocks. Thank you setting yourself apart from your competitors and offering a wide variety of beers! I enjoyed the Lemon Haze Pale Ale and my husband loved the Lucille Red Ale.  Keep up the fantastic beers and wide variety! Have been a bunch of times and can say they have great beer and great staff, especially the owners that make you feel like family. Awesome local hangout with really good beer. Happy to have them so close!! The fella and I stopped by with some friends on a Saturday afternoon to check it out before dinner. I agree with the other reviewer who said it feels like a cozy ski lodge. There are maybe 8-10 seats at the bar, two 4-top tables, and the rest of the seating is comfy-looking leather chairs scattered around in conversation set-ups with some around a fireplace.\\n\\nWhen we got there around 3:45 pm, the clientele was significantly older and loud. By the time we left around 6:15, it was pretty much full of college kids. The acoustics were a little crummy, and coupled with a full house, made it difficult to hear the people standing right next to me.\\n\\nService was decent, but the fella and his friend placed a couple of orders for one beer and got a different one - made it difficult to adequately review them. I\\'m not a beer drinker (but they had wine, too - hooray!), but the fella said their beers were decent. He got a flight of 5, and one was pretty good, three were decent, and one was pretty crummy.\\n\\nOnce they get a rhythm down, I think (hope?) they\\'ll get even better. This review is for Lauren!! Not only is she an awesome bartender at primal but we felt right at home upon meeting her! I personally think she\\'s exactly what any local brewery needs! I can\\'t fairly review the beer here as my husband is the beer drinker and my go to is wine! The wine selection is awesome for any of you who don\\'t do beer either! Ryan (my husband) doesn\\'t seem to LOVE the beers but did enjoy the centennial IPA!!also, amazing cozy atmosphere!! Perfect spot for a chill Saturday or weeknight drink! I recently made the road trip to this area to visit the breweries. I\\'ve been to D9 and Ass Clown just down the road, but never made it to Primal. Boy, that was a mistake. Primal had great beer, they had freshly popped Popcorn, and they serve wine. The inside Tap room is laid out well with plenty of seating, some open room, and several nooks for more private areas. The outside area is large, but is right next to the road, which can be a little noisy. But as usual, my brewery experience revolves around the beer. They had a wide selection with multiple IPA\\'s. I only tried 1, which was really good. Another great brewery to add to the list, and if you in this area, I would rank it first, though Ass Clown and D9 are also very good. This is exactly the type of place that Huntersville has always needed. Homey atmosphere, fantastic beer (try the Grim Creeper!), and the staff is always friendly. I always make sure to drop by whenever I\\'m back in town visiting my family. If you\\'re a Harry Potter fan then you will enjoy their variety of butter beers. Each beer tastes like they put a significant amount of butter in their beer. Definitely not worth going. Extremely mediocre at best. Visited Primal Brewery (PB) during the week thanks to a work-sponsored happy hour. When I pulled upon the PB sign, I drove into an unmarked gravel parking lot. However, I turned around and saw the PB parking lot sign so I drove around and parked in their own graveled lot.\\n\\nWhen I entered, I was struck by the cabin-in-the-woods feel. There\\'s wood everywhere. Also, they don\\'t seem to have a fully functioning A/C. This was a hot, July evening and the inside was stuffy, to say the least. \\n\\nI wasn\\'t in the mood for beer, so I was very appreciative that they had a wine list. I ordered a glass of Riesling which ended up being just as clear as tap water poured in a wine glass. Thanks to my coworkers, I was able to sample everyone\\'s beer selection. The peach flavored beer (I forget the actual name) was not a favorite, the saison was good, and the lemon flavored beer was a little bit of a letdown as well.\\n\\nThey have a food truck on site, Lake Norman Grill, that serves a limited menu of hamburgers, hot dogs, fried pickles, fried mac & cheese bites, pretzels, etc. I ordered fried pickles and was given a buzzer to wait for my food. Once my buzzer beeped, I picked up my food and brought in to share with my table. Completely underwhelming.\\n\\nAlso, while at PB, I went to the bathroom. HUGE negative that they have only ONE stall/toilet for ladies. Why is this a thing?! \\n\\nI\\'m very thankful for the fact that my job paid for the beverages because I cannot see myself going back to PB to pay for a drink. The hubby and I stopped in for a quick beer before going home. I\\'m not a beer drinker but oh how I enjoyed this. The bartender suggested \"lawn boy\" for me and this is what I get each time. A little popcorn as I sit by the fireplace drinking my beer! What more can you ask for? The beer is horrible and dave doesn\\'t know the difference between a cat and a dog. Primal Brewing is a bit of a drive but well worth the trip, especially if you combine it with a trip to some of the breweries in Cornelius. When you pull up, the lot looks very small, but the gravel lot directly to the right is for overflow. Out front there are several shaded picnic tables.\\n\\nThe Brewery and Taproom itself are on the small side, but this is a nano brewery. There\\'s fairly limited seating other than the bar, but what there is, is comfortable; lounge chairs and sofas.\\n\\nNow the important part, the beer.\\n\\nI was pretty impressed with the new kid on the block. The Grim Creeper Imperial IPA was well balanced and smooth for a high ABV beer. My next favorites were a tie between Devil\\'s Gas Pumpernickel Rye IPA (robust and malty with lots of depth) and Not So Harry Porter (no trying to be fancy, just an easy drinking well rounded porter). Hazelnut Stout gets an honorable mention.\\n\\nNice job lads and ladies!!! Great beer!   Nice selection. Relaxing atmosphere with a fire place!  We will be coming back! Had a wonderful time! Our bartender Jay was fantastically knowlegdeable about the brews and area. Had some excellent flights per his recomendation and learned lots! Good drafts, phenomenal vibes and lovely people. A very cool spot. I swung by one afternoon for a beverage after doing some research. They have a great and wide-ranging selection of beers for me having never heard of them until I drove past! It looks like they renovated an house into a brewery to be honest. Very quaint and compartmentalized with some high-top tables, bar seating, a couple couches, and some larger easy chairs. I also think they offer yoga on Tuesday nights, but I could be wrong.\\n\\nI had the Craven\\'s Elixir IPA (one of their four IPAs) and thought it was very good. A great amount of hops, great flavor. Will definitely be returning with friends and spreading the word! Beyond excellent beer. Jay,  working the bar, was one of the few bartenders (who after only serving me 1 drink)  was able to know what my next beer was (as I was already deciding mentally), before I even ordered.  I  had a sample of the exact beer I was contemplating ordering,  before I had finished my first. I\\'ve never had a more perceptive bartender. The bar was pretty packed for what I\\'d expect from a Sunday evening (only two seats empty at the bar,  and quite a few occupied tables). I plan on returning on any future trips to this area. I like the atmosphere at this brewery a lot.  The staff is always very nice and helpful with beer choices.  It is very cozy in the fall and winter, as they have a delightful fireplace and sitting area.  It\\'s always clean and tidy.  The beers on tap constantly rotate and many of them are pretty good.  In the summer, it can get really crowded and hot inside! They offer a patio in case you would like to step out for some air.  There are often a few food trucks present, which is a nice added touch.  There is also a large private parking lot which is easy to come in and out of, huge plus! I dropped into this cool little brewery after a late-day meeting in Huntersville, and was instantly impressed by the ambiance, the service, and the modest selection of munchies (pretzels, popcorn and OMG, COLD CUTS!). Oh, and the beer\\'s pretty good, too. At least, the Centennial IPA I tried was.\\n\\nWith ample indoor and outdoor seating, a firepit and indoor fireplace, this feels like combination Man Cave and Brewpub. A few more TVs would help, but the lack of ESPN screaming at you in the background means you can sit quietly by the fire and contemplate your beer. And when the beer\\'s this good, that\\'s a pretty smart call. It\\'s been a while since I was a beer snob (also coffee and whisky variously) so I don\\'t get excited much about \\'dark water\\' but the establishments that serve it are sometimes noteworthy. Primal has the perfect location, right about the time I\\'ve had my fill of sitting still in traffic there\\'s the option of sitting at a bar. Primal has been comfortable during my few visits, patrons and servers alike, the main room has the feel of a hill-country lodge, out front there\\'s a few umbrella-ed tables and a slew of full-sun seats over by the food truck/corn hole arena if you\\'re so inclined.\\nI wouldn\\'t try to offer a meaningful comment about weekend, lunch, or evening experience but others will have covered all that. The day time help Lauren is a good kid, knows what\\'s on tap and can help you make wise choices if you\\'re willing to help, otherwise you can work your way down the handles: saison, lawn boy, raspberry something... Word of caution though: seems there\\'s some sort of rotation with the offerings on tap so unless you are pretty regular you may miss one or double up.\\nBTW: Best thing about running a tab during a tornado warning; if the really bad thing happens your beer was free... The pumpkin spice brew was so freaking good... pumpkin pie spices on the rim? Yes please! Wow! The fried pickle chips at the food truck outside were some of the best I\\'ve ever had (I\\'ve had a lot). The inside and outside areas were beautiful and inviting and great for groups or a couple people to sit and enjoy. I will definitely be coming back here the next time I\\'m back in Charlotte on business to see what seasonal brews they have next. Primal Brewery is a quaint and small place up in Huntersville/Cornelius. It is one of my personal favorites in the area along with Ass Clown. It\\'s also conveniently located not far up the same road from Crafty Beer Guys where you can find some of Primal\\'s and other local breweries on tap.\\n\\nBack at Primal you can find a well varied selection of staple brews and the occasional small batch. Prices are about as to be expected from breweries in the area. Lawn Boy is about as close to basic American beer as they come - but with far more character. The hazelnutty goodness of Mother of Human Kindness is a stout made for the cold months. And my personal favorite would have to be the Lucille red ale. (I took a half-growler of it home on my last visit.)\\n\\nThe folks working here are fairly friendly and easygoing, as is the crowd. It also doesn\\'t get too crowded. Nowadays they have the almost requisite food truck parked outside. But if you\\'re just wanting a small bite they have hot pretzels and a steady flow of endless, buttery popcorn for a small fee inside. Whenever I find myself back up this way, Primal is one of the first places to come to mind. Great place to visit when North of Charlotte.  Beautiful outside seating with, of course, cornhole. Inside, decent bar seating, nooks with couches and a fire place for those cold days.  \\n\\nBrews are artfully displayed above the taps.  Jay was great and engaged all customers, young and old.  He made sure all were taken care of and answered questions about beer.  \\n\\nFor larger groups, they are allowed to serve two flights of six....see pic.  Which is epic to behold.  This way all beers can be sampled and a pint of your favorite ordered next.  None of the beers really stuck out to me or the hubby; however, they are decent beers with a large variety, which is nice. Good selection of beers, great service and atmosphere, occasional live music - that\\'s what makes Primal a local favorite. The fact that the owners are involved in the community and supportive of worthy causes (first responders, soup kitchen etc.) is a major bonus in my book! 5-Star praise from a non-beer drinker. I\\'ve never liked beer despite trying it NUMEROUS times times, but I still thoroughly enjoy going to Primal Brewery with my beer-drinking friends. They offer a nice selection of wines with generous pours. The staff is absolutely fantastic - personable, real, friendly, witty, and seriously appreciably funny. I give Primal Brewery 5 stars alone for the banter. If you\\'re looking for a fun place to hang out, this is the place. Finally a neighborhood joint I can get excited about,  If and when you pass by Primal do not be afraid, pull in and grab a pint! I really like the Ethel red ale and the Lemon Haze. I recommend trying the sampler so you can then decide which one you like then buy several! The wait to buy is a little long which says a lot of its popularity. \\nThey have outdoor seating but it was way too hot to be outside. Great place to hang out and have a really good micro brew.  Nice selection of 12 beers with clear definition of flavor, aroma and purpose.  The staff is great, very friendly.  Both the indoor and outdoor areas are comfortable. Live Music on Saturdays is always good.  No TVs, so you will have to make friends with the people in the place, which is very easy to do.  I highly recommend Primal for a local micro brewery. Great beer selection and very friendly crew. Nice atmosphere that seems to attract happy people. I\\'ll be back for sure!! Meh- it\\'s ok I guess. Huge outdoor seating- fireplace indoors- popcorn available- also serving wine and mimosas. Nice layout but minimal beer to offer. There was no food truck when we were there but it was raining. I\\'ll be honest, I don\\'t get a chance to venture out to Huntersville very often. I had a baby shower up this way on Saturday, so a bunch of us decided to meet the daddy to be and some friends here post pregnancy party.\\n\\nPrimal kinds of feels like being inside a house. I think someone else nailed it by using the word ski lodge. There\\'s a little bar area, a fireplaces, couches... it\\'s pretty cozy. A nice little brewery in the \\'burbs.\\n\\nThe six of us scoped out the chalkboard menu and claimed a little high top table as our home base. I am by no means a beer expert, snob, or connoisseur. I tried a couple different beers and liked them both. One was a ginger something and the other lemon haze. While trying to look up the beer names on Facebook, I saw on their page how they just did a soup kitchen takeover and fed over 200 people in need. Very cool! \\n\\nNon-beer drinkers, they do have wine and little bottles of champagne. Check their pages for updates on live music, food trucks, and other events. If you don\\'t live up in this area, I would recommend making a day of it and hit all these breweries up here (Primal, Ass Clown, D9, Bayne). Just make sure to have safe ride! This is an awesome brewery. The inside is very nicely done and is a great place to relax, and the beer has been fantastic. I highly recommend to anyone. Definitely can\\'t wait to return once the weather warms up a bit because there\\'s a great outdoor patio...Great spot off of Old Statesville. I had the pale ale which was pretty good. The inside is very clean and modern, not like some of the more rustic breweries in southend. I liked it though. Some nice sitting couches and tables, and a great bar area. We were in on a Friday night, with a pretty good crowd. There was even a food truck outside. The combo of food trucks and craft beer is such a genius one, and I respect any establishment that coordinates this! Great neighborhood brewery! Hubby and I had a Cravens IPA and their Imperial IPA ... Can\\'t remember it\\'s name. The imperial was our fav. We lucked up and were there on a night that they had a Food Truck...New Wrap Order. Tons of seating inside.. Tables, couches. Picnic tables, cornhole, and huge jinga game outside. Can\\'t wait to go back! Great beer, great place, excellent service from the women.....but especially the bearded guy! Last stop for the day. I love that you have a 4, 5 or 6 flight option here. Of course I went with the 6 flight option! This flight included: MOHK, Obsidian Lager, Grim Creeper, Lemon Haze Pale Ale, Porter and Lucille Red Ale. Boyfriend and I really enjoyed the MOHK, a hazelnut stout, and Porter. My personal favorite out of the beers that we tried was the Grim Creeper but since it was so high in alcohol I went with a pint of the runner-up Lucille Red Ale. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was inviting, people were so friendly minus one overserved gentleman who told me he needed to go wiz then laughed about it and said I did not need to know that.. why yes, you are correct. I also really liked the fireplace and outdoor seating area. I\\'ve been meaning to write a review for this place for a while but now seems fitting. We have been to Primal about 5 times now. We find the atmosphere great and the staff open to talk about their brewery and beers. There beer is good quality and a nice variety for the handful they\\'ll have on tap. I like the Sweet Lou, be sure to ask a brewer about it. Forgotten how enjoyable the beer garden is on a summer evening.  Loving the beer, hanging with friends and enjoying the vibe. Primal Brewery is a nice place for a group that wants to hang out.  The interior has a nice appeal, where you can just kick back and relax.  FYI - no TV\\'s for sporting events.   I have been several times when the staff have had a chili cook-off contest, which I loved!\\n\\nThe summer is pretty awesome as there is a large picnic area seating out front.  On weekends, one of Charlotte\\'s food trucks is usually stationed out  front too.\\n\\nGood times, good beer --- life is good..... Plenty of space outside to enjoy craft beer. Food truck outside and corn hole to keep you entertain. Strong beers still developing; this is a great space. Brewers are hands on and provide inside access to how they brew. Love the 60/40 split of nitrous to CO2, makes the beer smooth and easy to drink. Looking forward to seeing this space grow. Primal promoted a concert by Lake Street Dive (only band named and promoted) today with gates opening at 2pm and show starting at 4pm. I get forwarded an email late yesterday that Lake Street Dive isn\\'t really playing until 8:30pm. That is deceptive marketing. Visited Primal for the first time on a rainy Saturday evening. Walking in there was a great cozy and intimate ambience. The inside area is somewhat small with 4-5 tables, bar seating and some areas with couches. This is a great brewery to settle in with an old friend and catch up over a few beers. There are no Tvs, games etc. so be prepared to entertain yourselves and your friends with good conversation. I loved the fresh popped popcorn that was available to curb my beer infused munchies. The popcorn and the soft pretzels offered are the extent of the food served here however food trucks have been known to frequent the parking lot. After sampling 2 beers ( I had 2 of the 3 IPAs served -- my fav ) we came to the conclusion the beer is pretty good ! One strange drawback I found was there is no printed menu; they have drawings of each of the beers above the bar but the lamps made it difficult to read and for those without great eyesight nearly impossible . Suggestion to primal - print a small menu with descriptions of the beers to make available to your guests, it would do wonders !!\\nI\\'ll definitely go back but just not on football Sunday :). Great location and property. It stops there though. With as many good breweries around the area I don\\'t see the need to stop back. Mediocre beers. Very dull and flavorless. I\\'ve been to Primal twice now. It\\'s one of the newer breweries in the Charlotte area.\\n\\nThe bar is to the left as you walk in.  There are pub tables in the middle and then comfortable sofas and chairs in the two rooms off to the right. In the 2nd room on the right, there is a large fireplace. Out front there are picnic tables and there is cornhole on the left side of the building.\\n\\nThe beer is good here. I especially enjoy the hazelnut stout and their pale ales. \\n\\nWhile i enjoyed the beer and appreciate what they do, the fact that it was hot inside and loud as hell where I couldn\\'t even hear the people I was sitting with killed it for me where I had such an odd feeling here.  The place needs more softer textures to eat the noise. \\n\\nSo for this review I\\'ll leave the following ratings:\\n\\nStaff:  3\\nAtmosphere:  2\\nBeer:  4\\n\\nAverage:  3 stars My husband and I took our friend here and we had the best time. The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the beers they had on tap.\\n\\nThey offer 4,5 or 6 flights which is helpful since they have a lot of beer to try! We loved the primal fest and they also have a very good red ale\\'\\n\\nThere are plenty of seats, indoors and outside with both games for any section you sit in! Life size jenga, shut the box and corn hole.\\n\\nIt was a rainy day when we went and what I loved about this visit was that there was a local farmer that set up a stand inside to sell his produce!\\n\\nWe got a fresh eggplant and 3 tomatoes! I asked him if he is always there on Sunday\\'s ( yes primal is open on Sunday\\'s!!) and he was there that day due to the crazy rain. It was nice to see this local brewery support a local farmer!! Nice small place and the bartender was super friendly. Liked the decor as well. We had a flight and liked trying the different beer types. All in all a nice experience On a recent tour of Lake Norman area breweries, Primal was our first (and favorite) stop along I-77. I liked the tap room -- it felt like hanging out in someone\\'s swanky mountain house living room. As for beers, I enjoyed my Lucille Red Ale and Not so Harry Porter. The names made me chuckle. They were in a line up with the likes of Devils Gas, Grim Creeper and Cravens Elixir. Someone has a sense of humor! \\n\\nWhile I really liked my beers, for the sake of full disclosure, Ted wasn\\'t crazy about the IPAs he tried. I think he\\'d probably give them 3 or 4 stars. But, since I\\'m the one assigning stars, I\\'m giving 5. ;) \\n\\nI hate we\\'re not in Cornelius more often. If Primal was a little closer to home, I think we\\'d be regulars. I\\'ll just settle for hunting them down at beer fests and stopping before/after lake days! Charley Brown Ale was delicious! We met friends here on a weekend for a surprise party and had\\na blast! The Charley Brown Ale is sweet and had good notes of malt. The food truck was outside and we had party food so will try next time. They had a spacious reserved room for the party.  The parking is a gravel lot next door. Amazing atmosphere! Fantastic service! Delicious beer! You need to experience Primal Brewery. Now and often. Beer is not good at all! Have tried multiple times hoping it would be better because it\\'s a great space with a fun open patio area and always a good food truck. Also, it\\'s a bummer cause we are so close! Tasted like home brew. Will head down the a bit to D9 or ass clown! Visited for their Lake Street Dive concert - beers were OK, the lemon in particular was good.  Won\\'t be returning - didn\\'t think a 10 ounce pour should be $5 at the brewery. Additionally, $10 for parking was excessive.  Felt like they were price gouging the customers at every opportunity.  For a better experience, check music calendar at Pisgah Brewery in Black Mountain - where a $5 pour is a full pint glass of much better beer.  Oh, and free parking there too. 12 or so taps. Funky place. Bottomless popcorn for cheap. IPAs that aren\\'t overly bitter and the majority will enjoy. You\\'ll enjoy so much you may want a keg....we did. The pojo was what we liked and felt enough others would like to make it keg worthy. The craven was pretty similar with a different end bite, but also nearly keg worthy. Pojo took the prize tho, so all the others were very decent yet didn\\'t make the cut. Games outside for afternoons and a good space inside to hang. Small, but homey. I\\'d come again for sure. I\\'m from Beer City USA, so kind of picky. The beer was wonderful, the food truck had great food, the atmosphere really pulled it all together. Great selection of beer and extremely friendly service!  There is ample seating and a cool selection of games. Love this place.  Second time there, and loved it even more!  I always ask, \"what beers are new, and what\\'s the most popular.\" The bar tender was excited that her Primal Fest (fall seasonal) beer is back.   She even gave us a sample. Needless to say I loved it and got a glass of it. \\n\\nThe Primal Fest is so good.  Had a nice Amber color, and all the flavors were great.  The initial taste all the way to the after taste was spot on. Not one part of the tasting process did I not enjoy. I definitely want to get a growler full!\\n\\nThe decor of the place is so chill, they have a bar, high top chairs and tables, and leather lounge chairs for a more relaxing setting. \\n\\nAlso I love it when breweries have \"activities\". They have corn hole, life size Jenga, and shut the box!  Which is very addicting and your friends will love it! \\nWe never heard of it before, but heard it\\'s a popular southern game. I see why! Something small like having games or activities will help keep people engaged, and that means more beer sales since they are staying at the brewery.\\n\\nWe spent about 30 minutes at Crafty Beer Guys, had one beer and then went to Primal. Where we spent nearly 2 hours because we played games, which kept us buying more beer. Also unlike Crafty Beer Guys (2 miles up the road), Primal sells flights, which is a great start to try new beers before you pick a random one. \\n\\nI also love when breweries have stickers.  Something small, but the extra added touch is great. And it\\'s great marketing for them.  Especially for us since we put the stickers on our cooler that we take to tailgate. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I will TOTALLY be back.  Love this place. A good tip is to try the Harry Porter beer. A nice spin on Harry Potter, but it tastes good! Can\\'t wait to go back! Wanted to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather but music was so loud we had to leave. We could not talk to each other. Very unpleasant experience. This is an awesome brewery right off I-77.  They have a great selection of beer ranging from light to dark.  I love sitting out on the patio on a Friday night.  There\\'s plenty of parking and usually some entertainment.   Great spot for friends to chill. Last week, I attended an event that I\\'ll never forget!! Primal hosted their weekly Thursday night run, but with some subtle additions. They had an event hosted by Saucony & Black Men Run. It was epic. From the new beers, to the new buddies it was a great night. And I managed to rock the trails faster than anyone else there. Needless to say, my return to this event can\\'t come soon enough Honestly, I don\\'t really go out to breweries that often. i\\'m not crazy into the craft beers and all the cool things the kids are into. BUT. I love Primal! We\\'ve been wanting to stop by and see what it\\'s like and I\\'m so glad we did. The inside looks so much like a home, and you just want to stay there all night and drink.\\n\\nThere\\'s cute couches inside with board games around the room. The bar area is cute but also spacious. Of course, there\\'s corn hole outside, along with plenty of picnic bench seating. It\\'s dog friendly. The beers are fantastic. The service is good. There\\'s a popcorn machine inside and they have small snacks if you get the munchies.\\n\\nThere\\'s really not too much else to say about Primal Brewery. I\\'m into it. We have a new thing going, and I like it. Very cool spot in the lake Norman area. Fun outdoor area for adults and kiddos alike. And a more chill dimly lit vibe inside. I loved all the beers we sampled on our visit. And the staff couldn\\'t have been any nicer / more helpful :) I stopped by Primal while on a business trip.  First thing I noticed is that the building did not look like a traditional brewery.  The interior was inviting and relaxing, felt more like visiting someone\\'s home rather than a brewery.  I sat at the bar and asked about the type of beer I prefer.  The staff was very friendly and made beer recommendations as I expected but also discussed some of the various details of the beer and brewing it.  The beer was very good.  This is the brewery to stop at if you want to unwind and relax.  There are some games and I even noticed a fireplace.    Highly recommended. Just left this brewery. Enjoyed the beer & atmosphere but I have to say we were disappointed with our greeting to the place. Walked in- a blonde young lady was behind the counter. She had absolutely no time or desire to help us make a beer selection. We almost turned around and left with her attitude   We were unfamiliar with their beers so asked a few questions which she didn\\'t seem to appreciate at all- she gave us a few samples & I felt I better order something quickly before my husband said the hell with this?! We\\'re not a young couple so guess she felt we were just clueless. Won\\'t go back but there were people that were having a great time so I\\'m sure this was just my experience. The lady waiting on tables was super nice so it\\'s unfortunate we went inside to get served & that was our first impression. Good family atmosphere although I did have an employee kinda talk down to me about throwing a football to a group of kids and making sure it didn\\'t hit any patrons (which I would be mortified by).  I assured him it had not after a good hour of throwing the ball but somehow it managed to miraculously hit him on one of his trips out to grab glasses.   Ironically this happened when I was at the bar grabbing a beer.  Really lame for a place with below average to average beer at best compared to the other local breweries.  Food truck is average as well.  Small portions for the price, average taste, and definitely not a food truck that says \"lets got to primal because they have a food truck.\"  The only thing that keeps this place in business is its location because its definitely not the beer or food. Update 3/5/18\\nI\\'m so fed up with place.  The serve mediocre brews and their great ones are only seasonal.  Tonight they had an event and it was completely mismanaged.  Heck, no announcement of the judging of mugs eventhough i asked twice and someone else wins, unannounced to anyone.  Seems like BS.  I\\'m done with this piss poor management \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis place is awesome.  I\\'m dumbfounded by the babies who write bad reviews for incidents.  It\\'s a bar, grow up. Some times other patrons do stupid things.  Gosh, this younger generation feels so entitled that if they have a bad experience that they vent on social media and raise all sorts of hell as if they really matter to the rest of us. \\n\\nLet\\'s see, the bar maids know me and always have my beer pouring before i ask.  I never have to tell them my name for the next round because they already know who am I. Great patrons except for the entitled babies (perhaps you should visit some other establishment), the food truck is awesome, great atmosphere, dogs are welcomed and friendly. \\n\\nI can simply relax, enjoy some awesome beer, have some great conversation with other patrons (the non-babies), pet some nice dogs and listen to great nice tunes.\\n\\nThis was my favorite spot.  The service is always excellent but the beer is only so-so until they offer their \"seasonal\" selections...  East of Eden and Primal.  There are too many IPAs and those of us who don\\'t like it only have a few other selections.  I\\'m dumbfounded that the owners don\\'t make Primal Fest a regular selection.  When it\\'s available, customers order it continuously, yet it\\'s only offered for a limited time.  Go figure, take away a big seller for mediocre selections.  \\n\\nThis evening was the worst.  The live music was so loud that it was aggravating.  When he was on break, the background music was loud as well. I have hearing loss yet it was so loud that I couldn\\'t enjoy my time.  I was yelling at my wife just so she could hear me.  Why do establishments do this?  Just play the music at a normal level not 100db.  The live musician was mediocre and i came here to enjoy the evening but had to leave.  The beer selection was limited and the atmosphere was too loud. \\n\\nKeep it up and I will stop coming here This is an awesome place. It\\'s been through some growing pains over the years but has really established itself.  Excellent beer, good entertainment, good food trucks.  They even know who I am (because I\\'m here very often) The outdoor space was awesome, I wish we would have been able to grab some food from the food truck, but we didn\\'t. We both got flights and the beer was good! Very laid back atmosphere....tried a couple of different beers....very tasteful.  Staff was friendly and wonderful, I would certainly go back for the hospitality. This was my favorite spot.
